;;; .emacs --- Emacs initialization file -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Welcome to Emacs (http://go/emacs).
;;
;; If you see this file, your homedir was just created on this workstation.
;; That means either you are new to Google (in that case, welcome!) or you
;; got yourself a faster machine.
;;
;; Either way, the main goal of this configuration is to help you be more
;; productive; if you have ideas, praise or complaints, direct them to
;; emacs-users@google.com (http://g/emacs-users).  We'd especially like to hear
;; from you if you can think of ways to make this configuration better for the
;; next Noogler.
;;
;; If you want to learn more about Emacs at Google, see http://go/emacs.

;;; Code:

;; Use the 'google' package by default.
(require 'google)

(custom-set-variables

 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
